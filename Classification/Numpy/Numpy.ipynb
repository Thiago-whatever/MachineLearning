    "You should familiarize yourself with the `numpy.ndarray` class of python's `numpy` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to answer the following questions before starting this assignment. Let's assume `a` is a numpy array.\n",
    "* What is an array's shape (e.g., what is the meaning of `a.shape`)?  \n",
    "    - The shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n",
    "    - If, for example, you have a 2-D array with 2 rows and 3 columns, the shape of your array is (2, 3).\n",
    "* What is numpy's reshaping operation? How much computational over-head would it induce?\n",
    "    - Using arr.reshape() will give a new shape to an array without changing the data. Just remember that when you use the reshape method, the array you want to produce needs to have the same number of elements as the original array. If you start  with an array with 12 elements, you’ll need to make sure that your new array also has a total of 12 elements.\n",
    "    -  The computational overhead of the `numpy.reshape` operation is generally quite low. The reshaping process can often be performed in constant time, O(1), because it typically involves only changing the way that the array's shape metadata interprets the underlying data, rather than manipulating the data itself. If a copy is needed, then the operation would be O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This could happen, for example, when you want to change the order of elements in a way that isn't compatible with the original shape.\n",
    "* What is numpy's transpose operation, and how it is different from reshaping? Does it cause computation overhead?\n",
    "    - Returns an array with axes transposed.\n",
    "    - arr.transpose(), arr.T\n",
    "    - The key difference between `numpy.transpose` and `numpy.reshape` is that transpose operation changes the order of elements in the array by swapping the axes, while reshape operation changes the shape of the array without changing the order of elements.\n",
    "    - The `numpy.transpose` operation is O(1) because it just swaps the shape and stride information for each axis. No data needs to be copied for this to happen.\n",
    "* What is the meaning of the commands `a.reshape(-1, 1)` and `a.reshape(-1)`?\n",
    "    - `a.reshape(-1, 1)`: This command reshapes the array a into a 2D array with one column. For example, if a has 6 elements, a.reshape(-1, 1) will result in a 2D array with 6 rows and 1 column.\n",
    "    - `a.reshape(-1)`: This command flattens the array a into a 1D array. Regardless of the original shape of a, a.reshape(-1) will return a 1D array with the same total number of elements\n",
    "* Would happens to the variable `a` after we call `b = a.reshape(-1)`? Does any of `a`'s attributes change?\n",
    "    - When you call b = a.reshape(-1), the variable a itself does not change.\n",
    "    - All of the a atributes remain the same.\n",
    "* How do assignments in python and numpy work in general?\n",
    "    * Does the `b=a` statement use copying by value? Or is it copying by reference?\n",
    "    * Is the answer to the previous question change depending on whether `a` is a numpy array or a scalar value?\n",
    "        - In Python, the statement is copying by reference (unless a is an immutable object, like an integer, float or string [it creates a new object]). In the case of numpy arrays, the statement aso creates a new reference.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can answer all of these questions by\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Reading numpy's documentation from https://numpy.org/doc/stable/.\n",

    "This assignment's main objective is for you to learn how to utilize matrix operations, and avoid manual calculations as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "This objective will have the following benefits:\n",
    " 1. **Efficiency and Scalability**: Utilizing matrix operations will make your code way more efficient for two reasons:\n",
    " \n",
    "    1.1. **Single Processor Speed-Ups**: Using matrix operations can help your processor plan much better for cache placements, and data fetching. Most numerical computation libraries exploit features of efficient cache usage, SIMD features, etc. This can yield enormous speed-ups using the same computational resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2. **Multi-Processor Speed-Ups**: Matrix operations are extremely parallelizable. This has a significant impact on hardware acceleration; you could have a parallelizable code without even knowing much about parallelization, as most numerical computation libraries try to automatically exploit as much CPU parallelization as appropriate. \n",
    "    \n",
    "       Furthermore, you could easily use GPU acceleration for the same matrix operations if necessary. On the contrary, it is impractical to convert a python code which was built from scratch using python's default data structures for GPU usage.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    1.3. **Spending Less Time Executing High-Level Language Commands and Out-sourcing the Heavy-lifting to Lower-Level Backends**: The high-level languages tend to have expensive commands, as they prioritize coding convinience over efficiency. However, utilizing matrix operations outsources most of the code's heavy-lifting to lower-level languages without the user even knowing about it. For instance, Numpy runs most operations on a pre-compiled C backend. This is also correct about other numerical evaluation libraries such as the automatic-differentiation libraries (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. **Portabiliy**: This will make your code smaller, more understandable, and therefore less prone to have bugs. "
